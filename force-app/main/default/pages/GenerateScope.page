                <p>These, as well as any other conditions or provisions attached, are to be considered a part of this contract:</p>
                
                <p>The title and right of possession to the equipment or material we furnish remains in us until full purchase price (including any modification or extension of payments, whether evidenced by notes or otherwise) shall have been fully paid in cash:  and purchaser will do all acts necessary to perfect and maintain such retention of title in us.</p>
                
                <p>No part of the equipment furnished under this proposal shall be considered a fixture or incorporated into the realty by reason of its being attached to real estate, and any part may be separated from such real estate for purpose of repossession by us or our agents, without liability for such removal on our part, if purchaser has defaulted in payment of the purchase money.</p>
                
                <p>Time assigned for shipment is to commence from receipt of all approved data and is subject to fires, strikes, accidents or other delays unavoidable or beyond our reasonable control.  We assume no liability for damages due to delays or in erection.  The receipt of the equipment by purchaser shall constitute its acceptance of delivery, and waiver of any and all claims for loss or damage due to delay.  We will not make allowance for repairs or alterations unless made with our written consent or approval.  If shipment or erection of the equipment or any part thereof, shall, when ready, be delayed on your account, it is understood that payments shall be due as though shipment had been made or erection completed.  In case of such delay in shipment, it is also agreed that charge will be made for storage and/or any other expenses incurred by us.</p>
                
                <p>Workmen's compensation, public liability and property damage insurance are provided for all labor and superintendence furnished by us under this contract.  No other form of insurance will be provided unless herein specified or unless cost of premium is paid by the purchaser.  Fire insurance in an amount sufficient to protect our interests in the material or equipment sold is to be taken out and maintained by purchaser and the policies of insurance are to be made payable to us as our interests may appear at the time of loss.  Purchaser will assume all loss in the event of not having affected such insurance.</p>
                
                <p>It is expressly agreed that there are no promises, agreements or understandings outside of this contract:  That no agent or salesman has any authority to obligate this company by any terms, stipulations or conditions not herein expressed:   and that no modification of this contract shall be binding on us unless the same is in writing and approved by an executive officer.</p>
                
                <p>Unless specifically stated, this quotation does not comply with any local ordinance or regulation.</p>
                
                <p>The working days and hours of the superintendent and of such labor as we may supply on this contract will be on a standard work week of 40 hours, on an 8 hour day Monday through Friday.  If overtime is necessary or requested, cost shall be absorbed by the purchaser at regular overtime rate for the class of work required.</p>
                
                <p>Where state laws or municipal ordinances require permits to install equipment covered by this proposal, the purchaser assumes the responsibility for securing the approval of said plans and specifications from the proper state or municipal authorities and for payment of any required fees.  If any changes are required in the equipment covered by this proposal to meet the approval of said authorities, the purchaser shall inform us of such changes and shall reimburse us for changes actually made to comply with the requirements of said authorities.</p>

	                            If at any time, seller deems buyer’s credit unsatisfactory, seller reserves the right to require payment in advance, 
	                            or other security or guarantee that invoices will be paid promptly when due. If buyer fails to comply with the terms of payment

	                            to carrier at seller’s shipping point and such delivery shall constitute delivery to buyer. 
	                            Shipping dates or time of arrival of shipment at destination will not be guaranteed by seller. 
	                            Seller shall not be liable for any delays or defaults in making shipment where occasioned by any cause 
	                            of any kind or extent beyond its control, or the control of its suppliers, manufacturers or contractors,

	                        <p>
	                            When seller’s quotation prices or invoice charges for materials include standard shipping charges, it is understood that the 
	                            method of shipment will be at the seller’s option, and buyer is responsible for furnishing labor and equipment for unloading 
	                            within the time limit allowed by the carrier. Seller’s quotations do not guarantee to include all materials required for a 
	                            specific project, nor that the material quantities, sizes or specifications noted are correct. Buyer assumes all liability for 
	                            type and quantity of materials ordered. Orders are not subject to cancellation, return or back charge, or change in specifications, 
	                            shipping schedules or other conditions without the seller’s written consent. When orders have been filled as specified, no items 
	                            may be returned, nor will any credit be allowed, unless the consent of seller has first been secured, and only standard stock 
	                            items returned will, if accepted, be credited less the cost of handling and the freight costs involved. Materials not normally 
	                            stocked by seller may not be returned for credit.

	                            Except as otherwise provided, all quotations and sales shall be subject to these terms and conditions and buyer is conclusively 
	                            presumed to have accepted these terms and conditions unless otherwise agreed in writing. Orders designated to be invoiced directly 
	                            by the manufacturer are subject to acceptance by such manufacturer and to such manufacturer’s terms and conditions, and to these 
	                            terms and conditions. In the event of inconsistency or conflict between the terms and conditions of the manufacturer and seller, 
	                            the manufacturer’s terms and conditions that are involved in such inconsistency or conflict shall have priority.

	                            security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code in and lien upon such goods, as well as all attachments, additions and accessions 
	                            thereto, all as security for the payment of all such amounts and the performance by buyer of all its obligations to seller. 
	                            Buyer acknowledges that this security interest continues in all proceeds of such goods, attachments, additions and accessions, 
	                            including cash, checks, notes, accounts receivable, proceeds of the unearned premiums on property insurance and other collections 
	                            received by buyer. Buyer further acknowledges that seller’s purchase money security interest continues notwithstanding any attachment 
	                            or affixing of the goods, attachments, additions or accessions to real estate.

	                            acknowledgment in accordance with these terms and conditions shall be deemed a notification of objection to such additional or 
	                            different terms, or in the event such purchase order expressly limits acceptance to its terms, the seller’s acknowledgment shall 
	                            constitute an offer to sell that may be accepted only in accordance with these terms and conditions, without modification, addition or 
	                            alteration. Under those circumstances the failure of buyer to deliver notification of objection to these terms and conditions within a 
	                            reasonable time shall be deemed an acceptance hereof and a contract shall be formed only upon these terms and conditions.

	                            This agreement constitutes the sole and entire agreement between buyer and seller and none of the terms and conditions contained 
	                            herein may be added to, deleted, modified or altered except by written instrument signed by seller. There are no oral understandings,
